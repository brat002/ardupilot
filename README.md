#ArduPilot Project port for Revolution/RevoMini boards#

* near a half of code is fully rewritten
* external I2C bus moved out from FlexiPort by Soft_I2C driver so we always has at least 3 UARTs
* added 1 full-functional UART (only for quads) and 1 RX-only UART for DSM satellite receiver on OpLink connector
* Unlike many other boards, fully implemented registerPeriodicCallback & Co calls
* implemented register_io_process via simple cooperative multitasking
* added buzzer support
* stack now in CCM memory
* PPM and PWM inputs works via Timer's driver handlers
* added DSM and SBUS parsing on PPM input
* high-frequency (8kHz) advanced scheduler, common for all needs, capable to use semaphores with (optional) performance statistics
* all hardware description tables are now 'const' and locates in flash
* more reliable reset for I2C bus on hangups
* all drivers support set_retries()
* all delays - even microseconds - are very presize by using hardware clock counter (DWT_CYCCNT) in free-running mode
* separated USB and UART drivers
* new SoftwareSerial driver based on ST appnote
* now it uses MPU6000 DRDY output
* removed all compiler's warnings
* ported and slightly altered bootloader to support flashing and start firmware automatically at addresses 8010000 and 8020000
  (2 low 16k flash pages are used to emulate EEPROM)           
* EEPROM emulation altered to ensure the reliability of data storage at power failures
* optimized EEPROM usage by changing from 1-byte to 2-byte writes
* all internal calls use static private methods                
* removed unused files from "wirish" folder
* added support for baro MS5611 on external I2C
* micros() call uses 32-bit hardware timer instead of systick_micros()
* added translation layer between system PWM_MODES and board's PWM_MODES
* added initial support for DMA
* added support for all timers
* supported reboot to DFU mode (via "reboot to PX4 bootloader" in MP)
* after any Fault or Panic() automatically reboots to DFU mode
* diversity on RC_Input
* reverted idiotic mainline change in Periodic interface
* all used drivers altered to use "reschedule me" HAL feature
* added usage for Compass' DataReady pin
* unified exception handling
* added ability to bind Spectrum satellite without managed 3.3 DC-DC (requires short power off)
* added support for Arduino32 reset sequence - negative DTR edge on 1200 baud or '1eaf' packet with high DTR
* fixed hang on dataflash malfunction
* fixed USB characters loss *without* hangup if disconnected
* added failsafe on receiver's hangup - if no one channel changes in 60 seconds
* added HAL parameters support
* changed to simplify support of slightly different boards - eg. AirbotF4
* full support for AirbotF4 (separate binaries)
* added support for servos on Input port unused pins
* Added handling of FLASH_SR error bits, including automatic clearing of write protection 
* added Arduino-like support of relay on arbitrary pin 
* simplified UART driver, buffering now used even in non-blocking mode
* EEPROM emulation locks flash after each write
* EEPROM error handling
* fixed Ardupilot's stealing of Servos even they marked as "Unused"
* added compilation date & time to log output
* added SBUS input via USART1 as on Airbot boards
* added per-board read_me.md files
* fixed Dataflash logs bug from mainstream - now logs are persists between reboots!
* DMA mode for lagre SPI transfers
* USB virtual com-port can be connected to any UART - eg. for OSD or 3DR modems setup
* any UART can be connected to ESC for 4-way interface
* support for logs on SD card for AirbotV2 board
* fixed 2nd Dataflash logs bug from mainstream - now logs are persists between reboots even on boards having chips with 64k sector
* I2C wait time limited to 0.3s - no more forever hangs by external compass errors
* FlexiPort can be switced between UART and I2C by parameters
* The RCoutput module has been completely rewritten.
* For the PWM outputs, the error in setting the timer frequency has been compensated.
* Fixed bug with OneShot
* added parameter to set PWM mode
* added used memory reporting
* added I2C error reporting
* realized low-power idle state with WFE, TIMER6 used to generate events each 1uS
* added HAL_RC_INPUT parameter to allow to force RC input module
* added used stack reporting
* added generation of .DFU file
* time-consuming operations moved out from interrupt level to IO_Completion level with lowest possible priority
* added support for Clock Security System - if HSE fails in air system will use HSI instead
* added boardEmergencyHandler which will be called on any Fault or Panic() before halt - eg. to release parachute
* motor layout switched to per-board basis
* console assignment switched to per-board basis
* HAL switched to new DMA api with completion interrupts
* AirbotV2 is fully supported with SD card and OSD (OSD not tested, just compiles)
* added support for reading from SD card via USB - HAL parameter allows to be USB MassStorege
* fixed BUG in scheduler which periodically causes HardFault
* added check for stack overflow for low priority tasks
* all boards formats internal flash chip as FAT and allows access via USB
* added spi flash autodetection
* added support for TRIM command on FAT-formatted Dataflash
* fixed bug in hardware I2C driver which spoils writes to I2C2
* fixed bug in log write with different meanings of flags in FatFs and Posix
* rewritten SD library to support 'errno' and early distinguish between file and dir
* compass processing (4027uS) and baro processing(1271uS)  moved out from interrupt level to low-priority io level, because its
 execution time spoils loop time (500Hz = 2000uS for all)
* added reformatting of DataFlash in case of hard filesystem errors, which fixes FatFs bug when there is no free space
 after file overflows and then deleted
* added autodetect for all known types of baro on external I2C bus
* added autodetect for all known types ofcompass on external I2C bus
* added check to I2C_Mgr for same device on same bus - to prevent autodetection like MS5611 (already initialized) as BMP_085
* added time offset HAL parameter
* added time syncronization between board's time and GPS time - so logs now will show real local date&time
* i2c driver is fully rewritten, added parsing of bus error flags - ARLO & BERR
* errors at STOP don't cause data loss or time errors - bus reset scheduled as once io_task
* ALL I2C reads does via DMA!
* added parsing of TIMEOUT bus flag
* added asyncronous bus reset in case when loockup occures after STOP generation
* full BusReset changed to SoftReset on 1st try
* new SoftI2C driver uses timer and works in interrupts
* added support for SUMD and non-inverted SBUS via PPM pins
* added support for SUMD via UARTs
* MPU not uses FIFO - data readed out via interrupts
* added parameter allowing to defer EEPROM save up to disarm
* optimized multitask to not switch context if next task is the same as current. Real context switch occures in ~4% of calls to task scheduler
* all work with task list moved out to ISR level so there is no race condition anymore
* all work with semaphores moved out to the same ISR level so serialized by hardware and don't requires disabling interrupts
* ...
* a lot of minor enhancements

Incompatibility!!!

Since this controller is intended primarily for very small aircraft, the following unnecessary functions are disabled by default:
* Terrain following - there is no SD card
* Push Button
* Sprayer support
* EPM gripper support
* CLI support

If some of this is needed it can be enabled later

Also, this HAL now is not compatible with LibMapple/ArduinoSTM32 ("wirish" folder) - all imported files are altered.

Warning!!!
EEPROM emulation in Flash cause periodic program hunging on time of sector erase! So to allow auto-save parameters 
like MOT_THST_HOVER - MOT_HOVER_LEARN to be 2 you should defer parameter writing (Param HAL_EE_DEFER)
