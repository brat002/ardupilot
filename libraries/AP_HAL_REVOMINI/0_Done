 execution time spoils loop time (500Hz = 2000uS for all)
* added reformatting of DataFlash in case of hard filesystem errors, which fixes FatFs bug when there is no free space 
 after file overflows and then deleted
* added autodetect for all known types of baro on external I2C bus

* added check to I2C_Mgr for same device on same bus - to prevent autodetection like MS5611 (already initialized) as BMP_085

* added time syncronization between board's time and GPS time - so logs now will show real local date&time
* i2c driver is fully rewritten, added parsing of bus error flags - ARLO & BERR

* added support for SUMD via UARTs
* MPU not uses FIFO - data readed out via interrupts
* added parametr allowing to defer EEPROM save up to disarm
* optimized multitask to not switch context if next task is the same as current. Real context switch occures in ~4% of calls to task scheduler
* all work with task list moved out to ISR level so there is no race condition anymore
* all work with semaphores moved out to the same ISR level so serialized by hardware and don't requires disabling interrupts
* added parameter RC_FS to enable all RC failsafe
* added disabling of data cache on flash write, just for case (upstream has this update too)
* added a way to schedule context switch from ISR, eg. at data receive or IO_Complete
* added timeout to SPI flags waiting
* now task having started DMA IO goes to pause and resumes in IO_Completion ISR, not eating CPU time
* optimized I2C wait times to work on noisy lines
* greatly reduced time of reformatting of DataFlash to FAT
* I2C driver fully rewritten to work via interrupts
* ...
* a lot of minor enhancements


Warning!!!
EEPROM emulation in Flash cause periodic program hunging on time of sector erase! So to allow auto-save parameters
like MOT_THST_HOVER - MOT_HOVER_LEARN to be 2 you should defer parameter writing (Param HAL_EE_DEFER)
